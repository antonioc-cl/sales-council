# Eugene Schwartz

## Core Philosophy

Eugene Schwartz held that effective advertising **does not create new desires; it channels desires that already exist**. Copy doesn't "invent" needs: it takes hopes, dreams, fears, and ambitions that already live in the public's mind and directs them toward a specific product. That's why the copywriter's main job isn't to be "creative", but to be a **researcher of human desire**: find what the market intensely desires and show how the offer is the most direct and credible vehicle to obtain it.

Hence his concept of **"mass desire"**: a private desire that has spread massively. Great markets are built on a few deep desires (security, status, belonging, freedom, control, pleasure, etc.) that activate differently depending on the category. The copy's task is to choose **one dominant desire**, amplify it, and channel it; if you choose the wrong desire, everything else falls apart.

Another cornerstone of his philosophy is **adjusting the message to the market's level of consciousness and sophistication**. Most copy fails because:
1. It speaks to an **incorrect awareness level** (e.g., "hard sell" message to someone who still doesn't know they have a problem).
2. It ignores the **market's sophistication level** (e.g., launching generic promises in saturated markets that have already seen a thousand similar claims).

Schwartz solves this with his frameworks of **5 levels of awareness** and **5 levels of sophistication**, which force you to diagnose precisely who you're talking to, what they know, what they've seen, and what they're tired of hearing.

## Key Frameworks

### 1. 5 Levels of Awareness

Levels of the prospect's consciousness regarding their problem/solution/product. Each level requires a different type of copy.

1. **Unaware**
   - **State:** Not conscious of the problem, or doesn't recognize it as such. Not looking for a solution.
   - **What type of copy to use:**
     - Curiosity, story, drama, human insight headlines.
     - Talk about broad topics, stories, or everyday situations that awaken emotion or intrigue.
     - Don't immediately jump to "buy X": first open their eyes to the problem.
   - **Example (SaaS / productivity):**
     - Headline: *"The invisible cost of checking Slack 84 times a day"*
     - Then you tell a story about how attention fragmentation destroys deep work, and only later introduce your tool.
   - **How to diagnose:**
     - The market doesn't use clear words to describe the problem.
     - There are no obvious Google searches about the problem.
     - When interviewing users, they say "that's normal" or "that's just how it is", don't see it as something needing change.

2. **Problem Aware**
   - **State:** Knows something hurts: has an identifiable problem, frustration, or loss.
   - **What type of copy to use:**
     - Headlines focused on pain or consequence: *"Tired of X?"*
     - Copy that clarifies the problem, quantifies the cost, and increases urgency.
     - Still little focus on your product; much focus on the *pain*.
   - **Example (SaaS / remote team):**
     - Headline: *"Your remote team loses hours every week on useless meetings"*
     - Then you list symptoms (endless meetings, duplicated tasks), numbers (hours lost, cost), and only after: "There's a different way to coordinate..."
   - **How to diagnose:**
     - People actively complain about the situation (forums, networks, calls).
     - There are searches like "how to stop X", "solution for Y".
     - In interviews, users describe the problem but don't know solution categories well.

3. **Solution Aware**
   - **State:** Knows solutions (categories) for their problem exist, but doesn't know or differentiate specific products well.
   - **What type of copy to use:**
     - Headlines presenting the category + benefit: *"The platform that automates your task management"*
     - Messages comparing approaches ("before vs now"), explaining why this type of solution is better than other methods.
   - **Example (SaaS CRM):**
     - Headline: *"The CRM your salespeople actually use (without endless courses)"*
     - Then explain what makes your type of CRM different (simple, focused, without a thousand features).
   - **How to diagnose:**
     - The market says "we need a CRM", "we need an X tool".
     - Several categories compete (sheets, software, freelancers, agencies) to solve the same problem.
     - Your leads ask "How is this different from [classic category]?"

4. **Product Aware**
   - **State:** Knows your product (or several in your category) but isn't convinced to buy from you yet.
   - **What type of copy to use:**
     - Differentiation headlines: *"Why [your product] reduces churn 30% more than [competitor]"*
     - Lots of proof, comparisons, demos, concrete use cases.
     - Address specific objections (price, complexity, migration).
   - **Example (SaaS analytics):**
     - Headline: *"Switch from [Tool X] to [YourProduct] without losing a single dashboard"*
     - Copy focused on frictionless migration, support, key features.
   - **How to diagnose:**
     - People mention your brand or competitors directly.
     - They ask "Which plan is right for me?" more than "What does this do?".
     - They're in comparators, RFPs, reviewing pricing.

5. **Most Aware**
   - **State:** Knows who you are, what you do, and that you serve them. Just needs a push to buy.
   - **What type of copy to use:**
     - Direct action message: offer, bonus, urgency, ease.
     - Few explanations; more emphasis on low risk ("cancel anytime", "guarantee").
   - **Example (SaaS):**
     - Retargeting ad: *"Turn your trial into a Pro account today with 20% off"*
   - **How to diagnose:**
     - Users in free trial, on your list, or who requested demo.
     - Recurring visits to pricing page.
     - Questions like "When does the offer expire?", not "What is this?".

### 2. 5 Levels of Market Sophistication

Describes how a market evolves in terms of the quantity and type of promises it's already heard. Each level requires a different type of positioning.

1. **Level 1 – Be First**
   - **Situation:** You're the first clear solution for a desire. Almost no competition or similar claims.
   - **What to do:**
     - Make a simple, strong promise.
     - Emphasize the main benefit, without adornments or technicalities.
     - Prove it works (testimonials, demos) and that's it.
   - **Modern SaaS example:**
     - First SaaS that automates bank reconciliation in your country:
       - Headline: *"The first platform that automatically reconciles your banks and invoices"*
       - Then simple proofs: GIF of how it works, testimonials, time savings.
   - **Diagnosis:**
     - Few real alternatives.
     - Explaining **what your product does** already sounds novel.
     - The market reacts with "Does that exist?"

2. **Level 2 – Amplify the Claim**
   - **Situation:** There are competitors making the same basic promise.
   - **What to do:**
     - "Copy" the basic promise and expand it: better results, faster, easier.
     - Increase benefit intensity without lying.
   - **Modern SaaS example:**
     - If the pioneer promises "saves 5 hours a week", you communicate:
       - *"Save up to 10 hours a week by automating your bank reconciliations"*
     - Same benefit, amplified, with proof.
   - **Diagnosis:**
     - Several solutions promise essentially the same thing.
     - The market isn't totally saturated yet, but has already seen the "simple claim".

3. **Level 3 – Add Mechanism**
   - **Situation:** The market has heard all variants of the promise ("more, better, faster"). Skepticism begins.
   - **What to do:**
     - Introduce a **unique mechanism**: the concrete "how" that differentiates you.
     - Name that mechanism (method, brand, technology).
     - Explain briefly how it works.
   - **Modern SaaS example:**
     - *"Reconcile your banks in minutes with **BankMatch™**, our AI engine trained on thousands of bank statements"*
     - Mechanism = BankMatch™ + brief explanation of what makes it different.
   - **Diagnosis:**
     - Clients say "everyone promises the same thing".
     - You start winning or losing deals on implementation details, not high-level benefit.

4. **Level 4 – Amplify the Mechanism**
   - **Situation:** Now everyone starts copying mechanisms or saying they also have AI, algorithms, etc.
   - **What to do:**
     - Take the mechanism to the next level: faster, more complete, more automatic.
     - Elaborate the mechanism in the message (version 2.0, "full stack", "end-to-end", etc.).
   - **Modern SaaS example:**
     - *"BankMatch™ 2.0 automatically reviews 100% of your accounts and alerts you only on suspicious transactions"*
     - It's not just AI: it's AI + coverage + smart alerts.
   - **Diagnosis:**
     - Your market has seen many "magical methods" and "proprietary technologies".
     - They want to know why yours is superior in execution, not just different in name.

5. **Level 5 – Connect with Identity**
   - **Situation:** The market is saturated and cynical. They've heard all promises and mechanisms. They don't get excited by "more of the same".
   - **What to do:**
     - Change the battlefield: from the functional promise to **identity** and values.
     - Create narrative of "who this is for" and "what kind of person/company uses our solution".
     - Make the customer identify with a group or status.
   - **Modern SaaS example:**
     - *"The financial platform made for CFOs who don't tolerate surprises"*
     - *"The CRM for B2B teams obsessed with pipeline quality, not vanity metrics"*
     - It's belonging and identity more than feature.
   - **Diagnosis:**
     - Clients say "everyone's the same".
     - Major decisions are made by brand, community, values, culture, not by features.

### 3. Mass Desire

**Mass desire = massive desire.** It's the deep desire that:
- Is shared by a large number of people.
- Is intense and recurrent.
- Can be (partially) satisfied through your category.

**How to identify it:**

1. **Investigate emotions, not just functional problems.**
   - Problem: "my team disorganizes".
   - Mass desire behind: "I want to feel control, calm, efficiency; to be seen as a competent leader."

2. **Listen to how people speak.**
   - Interviews, reviews, communities: what words repeat? (e.g., "I'm exhausted", "I want to grow", "I'm frustrated wasting time", "I need freedom").

3. **Detect the dominant desire your product can amplify.**
   - There are several desires per product, but Schwartz insists on **choosing one as axis** and organizing the message around it.

**SaaS example:**
- Product: eCommerce reporting automation tool.
- Possible mass desires:
  - "I don't want to keep living glued to Excel" → desire for freedom.
  - "I want to make decisions with data, not intuition" → desire for certainty/control.
  - "I want to show results and be valued by my team/board" → desire for status and recognition.

Your main copy could channel, for example, **the desire for control + freedom**:
> "Finally you'll be able to close the month without staying up in Excel. [Product] consolidates all your data and delivers ready-to-present reports."

---

### 4. Intensification

Once the desire is recognized, Schwartz proposes **intensifying it**: make the prospect clearly see:
- Everything they will gain if they act.
- Everything they will keep losing if they do nothing.

**Key intensification techniques:**

1. **Paint concrete scenes (benefit in action).**
   - "Imagine arriving Monday at the office, opening [Product] and seeing all your KPIs ready..."
   - You don't speak in abstract, but in lived scenes.

2. **Extend the movie into the future.**
   - "In 3 months, your team will have forgotten manual reporting... in 6 months, you'll have a history that lets you negotiate better conditions with vendors."

3. **Before/after contrast.**
   - Show life with and without your solution, almost like two timelines.

4. **Multiply collateral benefits.**
   - Not just the direct benefit ("saves time"), but what that enables ("you can leave the office at 6", "you can plan instead of putting out fires").

**Application:**

- *Landing page:* "Before [Product] / After [Product]" sections, customer stories, result simulations.
- *Emails:* transformation storytelling, detailed testimonials, "day in the life" with and without the tool.
- *Ads:* brief reels or videos showing a mini transformation story; carousels with "Step 1, Step 2, Result".

---

### 5. Redefinition

**Redefinition** = change how the prospect perceives your product, especially when:
- They see it as very complex.
- They perceive it as trivial.
- They perceive it as expensive.

**Three typical moves:**

1. **Simplify the complex.**
   - Message: "It's easier than you think."
   - Show simple onboarding, templates, "done with you" support, clear analogies.

2. **Elevate the trivial.**
   - Message: "This isn't a detail, it's the core."
   - Reframe your "little thing" as a critical lever (e.g., a "simple" tag policy in CRM redefined as the basis of all revenue).

3. **Reframe the price.**
   - Compare vs. cost of doing nothing, vs. alternatives, vs. current waste.
   - Divide price into units ("< 2 coffees a day").
   - Position as investment/insurance rather than expense.

**SaaS example:**
- Objection: "Your product is expensive."
- Redefinition:
  - "It costs the same as one hour of your team per month... and saves you 20. Does it still sound expensive?"
  - "The real cost is continuing to make decisions with incomplete data."

---

### 6. Mechanization

**Mechanization** = turn your "how it works" into a **distinctive mechanism** that:

- Gives credibility to your promises.
- Differentiates you from competition.
- Generates curiosity.

**Steps:**

1. **Name the mechanism.**
   - *SmartSync™*, *BankMatch™*, *FocusScore™*, etc.

2. **Explain in simple how it operates.**
   - "It detects patterns in your bank movements, matches them with your SII invoices, and automatically marks the matches."

3. **Use it as narrative axis in more sophisticated markets.**
   - The headline and story revolve around the mechanism.

**Application:**

- *Landing page:* "How it works" block, right after hero: name + simple diagram + benefits.
- *Emails:* one email dedicated to "The secret behind [Product]" that explains the mechanism with metaphors.
- *Ads:* pieces showing the mechanism in action (gifs, demos), headlines like "Meet [MechanismName], the engine behind [benefit]".

## Signature Tactics (10 Key Tactics)

Below, 10 Schwartz tactics with examples and modern application.

---

### 1. Headlines by Awareness Level

**Idea:** Adjust the headline to the degree of consciousness.

- *Unaware:*
  - Example SaaS mental wellness:
    - Landing: "What silent stress is doing to your team (and almost no one sees)".
    - Email subject: "The statistic almost no HR wants to look at".
    - Ad: "Something is happening at your company after 8PM..."
- *Problem Aware:*
  - Example SaaS helpdesk:
    - Landing: "Tired of tickets that never close?".
    - Email subject: "How many open tickets are too many?".
    - Ad: "Your customers got tired of waiting for answers".
- *Solution Aware:*
  - Example SaaS project management:
    - Landing: "The platform that coordinates projects without endless meetings".
    - Email subject: "The new way to avoid meetings that could have been an email".
    - Ad: "Move from spreadsheets to visual flow in 15 minutes".
- *Product Aware:*
  - Example same SaaS:
    - Landing: "Why [YourProduct] reduces your team's overload 30% vs [Competitor]".
    - Email subject: "[Name], this is what [YourProduct] does different from [Competitor]".
    - Ad: "Already tried [YourProduct]? This is what a week with it looks like."
- *Most Aware:*
  - Example retargeting:
    - Landing: "Turn your trial into a Pro plan today with 2 months free".
    - Email subject: "Your trial expires in 48h (don't lose your boards)".
    - Ad: "Final notice: keep your automations with 20% off".

---

### 2. The First 50 Words

**Idea:** the first ~50 words (headline + subtitle + first sentence) decide if the reader continues.

- *Landing:*
  - Example SaaS reconciliation:
    - Title: "Reconcile your banks and invoices in minutes, not whole afternoons."
    - Subtitle: "With [Product], reconciliations do themselves while you focus on growing."
    - First sentence: "If you're still downloading statements and reviewing them one by one, you're still working like it's 2010."
- *Email:*
  - Subject + first line:
    - Subject: "Yesterday I spent 2 hours doing something your team also does".
    - 1st line: "And it was exactly the kind of task [Product] eliminates forever."
- *Ad:*
  - First words of copy:
    - "If managing a remote team has you on the edge of burnout, this is for you."

Rule: rewrite these first 50 words more times than any other part of the text.

---

### 3. Gradualization

**Idea:** take the reader step by step from what they already believe to the purchase conclusion.

- *SaaS landing (typical structure):*
  1. "We know coordinating a remote team is chaotic" (common ground).
  2. "This chaos costs you X hours and Y money per month."
  3. "There's a different way: automate coordination."
  4. "This is how [Product] works."
  5. "These teams already do it and this is what they achieve."
  6. "Choose your plan and start in 10 minutes."

- *Email sequence:*
  - Day 1: problem (recognition).
  - Day 3: consequences and cost.
  - Day 5: solution category.
  - Day 7: your product as natural option.
  - Day 9: success cases + urgency.

---

### 4. Mechanization

Apply what was seen above tactically:

- *Landing:* "How we achieve it" block right after hero:
  - "We use **SmartMatch™**, an AI engine that:
    - Reads your bank statements in seconds.
    - Automatically matches each transaction with your issued invoices.
    - Marks only the differences that need your attention."

- *Email:* subject like:
  - "The secret behind [Client X] closing the month in 2 days."

- *Ad:*
  - "How do we reconcile 5 banks in minutes? With SmartMatch™, our engine trained on thousands of real statements."

---

### 5. Specification

**Idea:** concrete numbers > vague promises.

- *Landing:*
  - Instead of "increases your productivity", use:
    - "Teams using [Product] reduce time spent on reports by **32%** in the first month."
  - Pricing: "$79 / month, no hidden charges. Cancel anytime."

- *Email:*
  - "In the last 6 months, [Product] users generated more than **3.2M** automatic reports."
  - "A single company saved **$18,500 USD** per year migrating from Excel to [Product]."

- *Ad:*
  - "Over 1,200 SMEs already sync their banks with [Product]."

---

### 6. Documentation

**Idea:** each claim should be accompanied by proof.

- *Landing:*
  - "What our customers say" section with testimonials + metrics.
  - Logos of known companies.
  - Real dashboard screenshots.
  - Mini case studies (1-2 paragraphs) with problem → solution → numerical result.

- *Email:*
  - Quotes: "As Marta, CFO of [company] said: 'We went from taking 5 days to 5 hours to close the month'."
  - Link to detailed case study.
  - Invitation to "try yourself" with sandbox or trial.

- *Ad:*
  - Short testimonial overlaid on image:
    - "'It saved us 40h/month' – Juan, Founder of [startup]".
  - Use stars / ratings when platform allows.

---

### 7. Future Pacing

**Idea:** make the reader "live" the future using your product.

- *Landing:*
  - Block: "This is what your next week with [Product] will look like":
    - Monday: reports ready at 9.
    - Wednesday: automatic alerts, no surprises.
    - Friday: you close the month in 3 clicks and go home at 6PM.

- *Email:*
  - "Imagine looking back in 30 days and...
    - you're no longer reviewing manual statements,
    - your team isn't chasing you for 'the updated Excel',
    - you finally have daily cash clarity."

- *Ad:*
  - "In 90 days you could be closing the month in half the time."

---

### 8. Connective Tissue

**Idea:** make the text so easy to read it's hard to leave.

- Use "bucket brigades":
  - "And that's not all..."
  - "But here's the important part:"
  - "Now, look at this..."
- Ask questions:
  - "What does this mean for you?"
  - "Why should you care?"
- Intriguing subheads:
  - "The mistake almost no one admits..."
  - "What your ERP will never tell you."

**Example of mini-section with good flow:**

> "You might be thinking now: 'Sounds good, but my operation is more complex.'
>
> Perfect. That's exactly why we built [Product].
>
> Let me show you how it adapts when you have more than 3 banks and 5 eCommerce stores..."

---

### 9. The Believability Dial

**Idea:** calibrate claims to be exciting but credible.

- Avoid:
  - "Multiplies your sales by 10 in one week."
- Prefer:
  - "Seeing 20-50% increases in your sales in the first 90 days is common among our clients... and in some cases reaches 100%."

Techniques:
- Use ranges, not rigid absolutes.
- Admit for whom your product is **not**.
- Lower adjective tone: less "revolutionary", more "proven in X companies".
- Place proof very close to strong claim.

- *Landing:*
  - "We're not the tool for you if you're looking for magic without changing any process.
    But if you're willing to invest 2 weeks in implementing [Product] well, this is what you can expect..."

---

### 10. The First 50 Words (Again, Tactical)

Schwartz literally worked a week on the first lines. Ultra-concrete application:

- In a SaaS sales doc, before writing the rest:
  1. Write 10-20 title variants.
  2. 10-20 subtitle variants.
  3. 5-10 different first sentences.
  4. Choose the best combinations and test them (A/B in ads, different landing versions).

---

## Quotable Lines

1. "Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those desires onto a particular product."
2. "Your headline has only one job — to stop your prospect and compel him to read the second sentence of your ad. The second sentence has only one job — to get him to read the third. And so on."
3. "Mass desire is the public spread of a private want."
4. "Every product appeals to two, three or four of these mass desires. But only one can predominate… Your choice among these alternate desires is the most important step in writing your ad. If it is wrong, nothing else that you do in the ad will matter."
5. "People don't read ads. They read what interests them. Sometimes it's an ad."
6. "There is your reader. He is motionless, preoccupied, almost certainly bored. Your first job is to get his attention. Then, keep it."
7. "The prospect knows he wants the end result; now he wants to know how you're going to give it to him. He is saying, 'How does it work?'"
8. "Creation is nothing original; creation is taking two separate ideas and joining them."
9. "The greatest mistake marketers make is trying to create mass desire, instead of directing it."
10. "Long copy is not bad; boring copy is bad."

---

## Best For (When to activate this advisor)

Activate "Schwartz" when:

- You're writing or rewriting **sales landing pages** (especially with cold or performance traffic).
- You need to design **ad headlines** (Google, Meta, LinkedIn) that really fit the market's awareness and sophistication.
- You're designing **email sequences** for onboarding, nurturing, or launch.
- You're defining **messaging and positioning**: which main promise to choose, which mass desire to channel, which mechanism to highlight.
- You operate in a **saturated market** and need to find a new angle (level 4-5 sophistication).
- You must write **pricing pages** where you have to justify value, work objections, and reframe price.
- You prepare **lead magnets** or registration pages that must convert cold traffic into interested leads.

---

## Red Flags (When NOT to use)

- **Live sales, spontaneous conversations:** his approach is for structured written copy. In a 1:1 call, applying too rigid frameworks can sound robotic.
- **Markets of very low awareness and no clear desire:** if the problem isn't yet perceived, you first need education, community, content... and only then the "full Schwartz" arsenal.
- **Without audience research:** using these frameworks without real customer data is guessing. If you haven't interviewed, analyzed feedback, reviewed real customer language, you can get mass desire and awareness level wrong.

---

## Synergies (Combines well with)

- **Alex Hormozi:**
  - Hormozi designs the **offer** (value stack, bonuses, guarantees, pricing).
  - Schwartz designs the **copy that sells that offer**, aligned to desire and awareness.
  - Flow: first you define an offer so good it'd be stupid to say no (Hormozi), then use Schwartz to express it so the audience can't ignore it.

- **Robert Cialdini:**
  - Schwartz = macro structure of the message (desire, sequence, mechanism).
  - Cialdini = **psychological levers** you insert in the message body (social proof, scarcity, authority, commitment, etc.).
  - For example: you use intensification + future pacing for desire; then reinforce with social proof (testimonials) and scarcity (limited spots) at the end.

- **Oren Klaff:**
  - Schwartz tells you "what the prospect knows" (awareness) and "what they've already seen" (sophistication).
  - Klaff tells you "what frame you should hold" in a presentation or pitch to maintain control.
  - Together, awareness + frames = messages aligned to both mental level and status/attention game.

---

## Anti-patterns (Conflicts with)

- **"Just be authentic" understood as "write without strategy":**
  - Schwartz isn't against authenticity, but against structureless improvisation. If your philosophy is "I write what comes out and that's it", it clashes with the idea of precisely mapping awareness and sophistication.

- **Feature-first messaging:**
  - Starting to talk about features and technology without connecting to desire is the opposite of his approach. For Schwartz, you start in **desire → benefit → then feature as mechanism that enables it**.

- **Copy without research:**
  - Brainstorming claims in a room without customer data is anti-Schwartz.
  - He spent most of his time studying market, products, competitors, and customers before writing. If you're not willing to do that part, you'll only apply the "shell" of his techniques, not the substance.
