# Chris Voss

## Core Philosophy
Chris Voss, ex-FBI hostage negotiator, applies his crisis tactics to the business world. His central philosophy is that negotiation is not about cold logic or "giving ground", but about **connecting with human emotions and motivations** to influence the outcome. For him, *"negotiation is not an act of battle; it's a discovery process"*. Instead of seeing the other side as an enemy, Voss teaches to see them as **source of information**: each question and each silence seek to reveal key data about their true interests.

Voss's mantra, **"Never Split the Difference"**, reflects his rejection of half-measures compromise. Splitting the difference (50/50 concession) often leaves both parties dissatisfied. Instead of a simplistic "win-win", he proposes *discovering hidden truths* (**Black Swans**) that change the dynamics and generate creative agreements of greater value. **Conceding to avoid conflict is a mistake**; Voss learned in the FBI that true influence springs from **tactical empathy** (deeply understanding the other) and treating negotiation as exploration, never as confrontation. In summary, for Voss negotiating is **informing and empathizing strategically**, never simply splitting the difference.

## Key Frameworks

### Tactical Empathy
**What it is:**
It is the ability to put yourself in the other's place *strategically*. It involves actively recognizing the other party's feelings and perspectives, **without needing to agree**, and using that understanding to your advantage. It's not sympathy or pleasing: it's showing the other *"I understand how you feel"* to lower their defenses.

**Price negotiation**
Before talking numbers, demonstrate you understand their concern. Example:
> "It seems you're concerned about the limited budget you have."

Validating their concern (without promising to lower price yet) builds trust and disposes them to explain more.

**Objection handling**
Listen and acknowledge the emotion behind "it's too expensive" or "I don't see it clearly":

> "I understand you're afraid to invest and that it won't meet your expectations."

By labeling their fear like this, you make them feel heard and they're more likely to say "that's right", confirming you got their point. From there, you can explore solutions.

**Difficult conversations with clients**
If a client is upset (for example, wants to cancel):

> "It sounds like you feel disappointed with the results."

This validation disarms the initial confrontation and prepares the ground to solve the problem together instead of arguing.

---

### The Black Swan
**What it is:**
Voss calls *"black swans"* those unknown data points that, when revealed, can **change everything** in a negotiation. They are unspoken needs, internal constraints, secret motivations. His strategy is to **continuously search for those surprises** by asking and listening carefully.

**Price negotiation**
Assume there's a hidden factor behind the other party's price position. Example:

> "What would happen if we don't reach an agreement before month-end?"

It might reveal they have an internal deadline, a KPI, a bonus, etc. With that black swan, you can adjust timelines, deliverables, or conditions to tilt the balance in your favor.

**Objection handling**
The explicit objection ("it's too expensive") might not be the real obstacle. Use calibrated questions:

> "What makes you see this price as high?"

There the black swan might appear: a bad experience, internal pressure, fear of losing their job, etc. Once revealed, the conversation is no longer "expensive price" but how to resolve *that* real concern.

**Difficult conversations with clients**
In a churn conversation, there's probably a black swan behind "we want to cancel": maybe internal political pressure, a new boss, or a competitor getting in. Questions like:

> "It sounds like there's something else behind this decision, what has changed on your side lately?"

Can reveal that hidden factor that lets you propose alternatives (for example, a pilot adapted to the new boss).

### Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM)
**What it is:**
FBI's stepped model that Voss adapts to business. 5 rungs:

1. **Active listening**
2. **Empathy**
3. **Rapport (tuning)**
4. **Influence**
5. **Behavioral change**

Without the previous rungs, behavioral change (that they accept your proposal) is almost impossible.

**Price negotiation**
- **Listen:** let the client explain why they're asking for lower price.
- **Empathy:**
  > "I understand you're under a lot of budget pressure this quarter."
- **Rapport:** the client feels you're on their side.
- **Influence:** now you propose:
  > "What if we keep the price but adjust the scope to fit your budget?"
- **Change:** they accept the agreement because they felt heard and respected.

**Objection handling**
- Listen to all objections without interrupting.
- Empathize and summarize:
  > "I see you're concerned about A, B, and C."
- Generate rapport ("finally someone who understands").
- Then influence with alternatives and proof of concept.
- The change is client goes from "no" to "let's explore this".

**Difficult conversations with clients**
In churn:

1. Listen to the full complaint.
2. Empathize:
   > "I understand why you're upset; I'd probably feel the same in your place."
3. Rapport: client lowers defenses.
4. Influence:
   > "Would it make sense to try a more limited plan while we fix X?"
5. Change: reconsider canceling.

---

### Accusation Audit
**What it is:**
*Accusation audit*: **mention in advance** the worst things the other party might think of you, before they say it. Example:

> "You probably think I just want to sell you something expensive and disappear."

By expressing it yourself, you take away its power and often the other is forced to soften:

> "No, not that much... I just want to make sure it's worth it."

**Price negotiation**
Before talking figures:

> "You might think we're going to be inflexible on price and that we just want to charge you."

Disarms the future objection of "you just want to extract money" and allows a cleaner value discussion.

**Objection handling**
At the start of a call with skeptical prospect:

> "It might seem like I'm just another one trying to shove software you don't need down your throat."

They probably respond:

> "No, relax, I just want to understand if this actually adds something."

You now have permission to explain without them seeing you as a "salesperson".

**Difficult conversations with clients**
To deliver bad news:

> "You're going to feel like we don't value you as a customer and that we've failed you."

That lowers the anger because you already said the "unsayable". From there, it's easier to enter *"ok, tell me what happened"*.

### The 7-38-55 Rule
**What it is:**
Mehrabian's rule:
- 7% = words
- 38% = tone
- 55% = body language

Voss uses it to remember that **how matters much more than what**.

**Price negotiation**
- Give the price with tone of **calm confidence**, not as a question:
  > "The plan would be $1,800 monthly."
- Observe the other's body/voice: if they lean back, cross arms, or change tone, there's noise even if they say "I see".

**Objection handling**
If the client says "I understand" with irritated tone, the relevant thing is the 93% non-verbal. You can say:

> "I notice from your tone that this still bothers you, what part doesn't add up?"

You also watch your tone: avoid sounding defensive.

**Difficult conversations with clients**
- Open posture, visible hands, calm gaze.
- Low, measured voice for bad news.
- Align your body language with your message: saying "I take you very seriously" while looking at your phone = total incoherence.

---

### That's Right vs You're Right
**What it is:**
- *"You’re right"* (tienes razón) is usually **to get rid of you**.
- *"That's right"* (así es / eso es correcto) means **deep understanding**: they have embraced your summary of the situation.

Voss wants you to pursue *"that's right"*, not "you’re right".

**Price negotiation**
Before closing:

> "So for you it's key that the solution pays for itself in under 6 months and you're afraid to invest something that won't return that investment, right?"

If they respond:

> "That's right"

They're already validating the framework from which you justify your price.

**Objection handling**
Don't sell: **summarize** their position.

> "If you don't see how this integrates with what you already have, you won't move forward, and that worries you because you might look bad internally. Is that it?"

When they say:

> "Exactly, that's it"

You've got them in collaboration mode.

**Difficult conversations with clients**
Angry client:

> "What happened is you made me look bad in front of my own customer because of an error of yours, and I feel like you abandoned me at a critical moment."

If they respond "That's exactly it", you've just earned moral permission to propose how to fix it.

## Signature Tactics

### 1. Mirroring
**What it is:**
Repeating the last 1-3 words (or key idea) of what the other said, with curious tone. It's a "mirror" that makes them keep talking.

**Exact script**
- Client: "The cost of this solution is too high for us."
- You: "Too high?"

- Client: "We're not ready to decide now."
- You: "Not ready to decide now?"

**Ideal context**
- Discovery, objections, moments where you want them to elaborate.
- Price negotiation when they give you a "I can't pay that".

**Common mistakes**
- Abusing it: mirroring every sentence sounds weird.
- Changing tone to sarcastic.
- Rephrasing instead of repeating; the mirror is literal or almost literal.

---

### 2. Labeling
**What it is:**
Naming the other's emotion or perspective with phrases like:

> "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." / "It looks like..."

**Exact script**
- "It seems like this worries you quite a bit."
- "It sounds like you've had bad experiences with providers before."
- "It's clear you're frustrated with the results so far."

**Ideal context**
- Emotionally charged objections.
- Difficult calls.
- When discussing price and feeling tension in the air.

**Common mistakes**
- Saying "I think you..." (sounds judgmental).
- Using only "I understand" without specifying what you understand.
- Not shutting up after the label: label → silence.

---

### 3. Calibrated Questions
**What it is:**
Open questions starting with **"how"** or **"what"** that guide the conversation and extract information without triggering defensiveness.

**Exact script**
- "How do you see this fitting into your current budget?"
- "What obstacles do you see to approve this internally?"
- "How could we structure it so it makes sense to move forward?"

Classic Voss:
> "How do you expect me to do that?"

Said with neutral tone, not challenging.

**Ideal context**
- When the client asks for something difficult (big discount, impossible deadline).
- When you suspect there's a black swan behind.
- To transform a "no" into conversation.

**Common mistakes**
- Sounding interrogatory / police-like.
- Using "why?" (sounds accusatory).
- Not really listening to the response.

---

### 4. No-oriented Questions
**What it is:**
Questions designed to make the other feel comfortable saying **"no"**, which paradoxically opens the door.

**Exact script**
- "Is this a bad time to talk?"
- "Would it bother you if we looked at this for 5 minutes?"
- Email to lost lead: "Have you given up on this project?"

**Ideal context**
- Start of cold calls.
- Revive conversations that cooled off.
- Reopen negotiations where the other doesn't respond.

**Common mistakes**
- Questions like "Don't you want to do what's best for your company?" (obvious manipulation).
- Using too many in a row.
- Not waiting for the response (you ask and keep talking).

---

### 5. Late-night FM DJ Voice
**What it is:**
**Calm, low, slow** voice tone like late-night radio DJ.

**Exact script**
*(imagining the voice)*
- "Relax, we're going to find a way to make this work..."
- "I understand what you're feeling, and I'm here to help you solve it..."

**Ideal context**
- Angry or anxious client.
- Tense moments: give price, deliver bad news.
- When you want to convey control and safety.

**Common mistakes**
- Becoming monotonous or sounding condescending.
- Using it out of context when everything is relaxed.
- Not accompanying it with empathetic words (only "zen tone" empty).

---

### 6. The Ackerman Model
**What it is:**
Offer/counteroffer strategy in steps: 65% – 85% – 95% – 100% of your goal, with increasingly smaller concessions.

**Exact script (as buyer asking for discount)**
- Goal: pay 10,000.
  1. "Right now I could only consider 6,500."
  2. "I understand what you say. I could go up to 8,500 if that lets us close."
  3. "I know you're making an effort. I can get to 9,500, and that's really my limit."
  4. "I've reviewed everything; the most I can commit to is 9,980."

**Ideal context**
- Expected bargaining (vendors, large contracts, enterprise).
- Negotiations where there's real price-play room.

**Common mistakes**
- Not preparing the numbers beforehand.
- Making large concessions at the end (breaks the pattern).
- Not using empathy between offer and offer (you seem like a cold bargainer).

---

### 7. "That's right"
**What it is:**
It's not your phrase, but the **reaction** you seek:

> "That's right" / "Exactly."

You get it with impeccable empathetic summaries.

**Exact script**
- "So: you need X, you're worried about Y, and you don't want to repeat the error of Z. Did I get it right?"

If they answer "That's right", you're aligned.

**Ideal context**
- When there's friction, before proposing solution.
- Before talking about final price.
- In churn: validate their anger and context.

**Common mistakes**
- Disguising pitch as summary ("...and that's why our solution is perfect, right?").
- Settling for "you're right" and thinking you've won.
- Making endless summaries.

---

### 8. Strategic Silence
**What it is:**
Throw a question, label or offer and **shut up on purpose** so the other fills the void.

**Exact script**
There's no phrase, there's **pause**. Example:

- You: "What would the next step look like from your side?"
- (silence; breathe; count to 5 mentally...)

**Ideal context**
- After saying your price.
- After asking a calibrated question.
- After they say "no".

**Common mistakes**
- Breaking the silence out of discomfort.
- Showing impatience with gestures.
- Not having prepared what to do when they finally respond.

---

### 9. The F-word (Fair)
**What it is:**
"Fair" is an emotional trigger. It can be:

- Manipulation: "I made you a fair offer."
- Real complaint: "I just want something fair."
- Positive tool if you use it first.

**Exact script**
- Defense against manipulation:
  > "I'm willing to go point by point on why you consider it fair. If it is, I'll accept it; if we find it's not, would you be willing to adjust it?"

- Against real complaint:
  > "If you've used the word 'fair', it's because at some point you felt mistreated. I apologize. When did it start seeming unfair to you so we can fix it?"

- Preventive use:
  > "I want this to be fair for both of us. If at any point you feel it's not, tell me so we can review it."

**Ideal context**
- Long negotiations where frictions accumulate.
- Clients sensitive to equity.
- Situations where you foresee they might use "it's not fair" as a weapon.

**Common mistakes**
- Avoiding the word "fair" out of fear.
- Responding defensively to "it's not fair".
- Selling your offer as "the only fair one" and then conceding a lot.

---

### 10. Bending Reality
**What it is:**
"Bending reality" = using **anchoring**, **deadlines** and **loss aversion** to change perception of what's reasonable.

**Exact script**
- Emotional anchoring:
  > "The number I'm going to tell you is going to seem high at first..."

- Numerical anchoring:
  > "Similar projects in companies like yours are in the 200,000 to 250,000 range."

Then your 120,000 offer seems "cheap".

- Deadline:
  > "If we close before month-end I can keep this package of conditions. After that date my implementation capacity changes."

- Loss aversion:
  > "Every month you don't fix this you're leaving at least X in unnecessary costs on the table."

**Ideal context**
- Long negotiations.
- High-ticket sales.
- When the other party is indecisive and underestimates the cost of not acting.

**Common mistakes**
- Lying with deadlines or references.
- Going too aggressive with the anchor.
- Not combining it with empathy (you seem like cheap manipulator).

## Quotable Lines

1. **"Negotiation is not an act of battle; it's a discovery process."**
2. **"If you split the difference, both sides lose."**
3. **"'No' is the start of negotiation, not the end."**
4. **"The two most powerful words you can hear in a negotiation are: 'That's right'."**
5. **"Listen to understand, not to respond."**
6. **"Label negative emotions to neutralize them."**
7. **"In life you don't get what's fair; you get what you negotiate."**
8. **"Persuasion isn't about you, it's about them."**
9. **"Never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't be able to accept something better."**
10. **"A 'yes' is worth nothing until it comes with a 'how will we do it?'."**

---

## Best For (When to activate this advisor)

- **Price/contract negotiation**
  When setting prices, discounts, renewals, or contractual conditions (SaaS, services, retainers).

- **Objection handling in calls**
  When in the call come out "it's too expensive", "not a priority", "let me think about it".

- **Churn/cancellation conversations**
  Client who wants to leave or "pause" the service. You need to de-escalate and negotiate alternatives.

- **Vendor/supplier negotiation**
  When you're the client and want better conditions without breaking relationship.

- **Any difficult conversation with client**
  Price increases, delays, serious bugs, scope redefinition.

- **When you need information the other doesn't want to give**
  Real timeline, budget, decision-makers, internal constraints.

- **Email responses to objections**
  For emails like "it's too expensive", "we're not continuing", "we're going with another provider".

---

## Red Flags (When NOT to use)

- **Relationships without tension**
  Easy renewals, very satisfied clients, routine purchases.

- **Purely transactional transactions**
  E-commerce, retail without negotiation, very low tickets.

- **When you have all the power and want to preserve relationship**
  Monopoly, high client dependency. Empathy yes; too tactical maneuvers can sound manipulative.

- **Copywriting for masses**
  Ads, cold traffic landings: these tactics are micro-surgical 1:1, not for huge audiences.

---

## Synergies (Combines well with)

- **SPIN Selling (Rackham)**
  SPIN for discovery (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need) + Voss for negotiation and closing.
  Mental flow: *SPIN understands, Voss negotiates*.

- **Oren Klaff (frame control)**
  Klaff defines the **frame** (status, who leads the meeting), Voss adds **tactical empathy** so you don't seem like a despot.
  High status + deep understanding = warm authority.

- **Cialdini (Influence)**
  You combine reciprocity, scarcity, social approval, etc., triggers with the way Voss talks about them conversationally.
  Cialdini defines *which lever*, Voss *how to use it in conversation*.

---

## Anti-patterns (Conflicts with)

- **Direct confrontational approaches**
  "Take it or leave it" style, quick ultimatums, raising voice.
  Voss is firm, but not gratuitously confrontational.

- **Simplistic "win-win"**
  Classic "split the difference" so everyone "wins" a little.
  Voss seeks creative agreements based on information, not weak 50/50.

- **Conceding to "maintain the relationship"**
  The pattern of "so they don't get angry, I concede everything".
  Voss tolerates healthy tension to achieve better agreements, not avoids it at all costs.
