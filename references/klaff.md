# Oren Klaff

## Core Philosophy

Oren Klaff bases his approach on frame control during any sales or negotiation interaction. A *frame* is the perspective or "lens" through which we interpret the situation; in every business meeting frames are in play, and when two people interact frames clash until one dominates. Klaff argues that whoever controls the frame controls the conversation and, therefore, the outcome. This means instead of reacting to the other person's pressures or agendas, you must establish your own framework and make the other react to you. His implicit mantra: *when you react to the other person, they own the frame; when the other person reacts to what you do and say, you own the frame*. In practice, this means taking initiative, surprising and challenging strategically, instead of falling into the prospect's game.

Another central piece of his philosophy is applied neuroscience to sales. Klaff explains that our brain processes information at three levels: first the "croc brain" (reptilian brain), responsible for survival and basic reactions; then the emotional middle brain; and finally the rational neocortex. Traditional pitches often fail because they go directly to the neocortex with boring logical data and details, ignoring that the initial filter is the croc brain. This primitive brain tends to discard information that isn't novel or seems complicated, or perceives it as a threat. That's why Klaff emphasizes starting any presentation with simple, surprising, and exciting elements that hook the listener's basic instinct. If you don't first capture primal attention—with curiosity, tension, or emotion—your logical arguments never pass the filter.

Finally, Klaff introduces a radical mindset shift: *"you are the prize, not the buyer"*. Many salespeople approach meetings as if the client were doing them a favor by listening, which places them in a position of low authority. Klaff inverts this paradigm with the prize frame: you must behave as the prize to win, someone valuable and scarce with whom the client would be lucky to work. This doesn't mean being arrogant without foundation, but having the conviction (and demonstrating it) that your solution is valuable and that you're not there begging, but evaluating a mutually beneficial collaboration. By projecting that high status calmly and confidently, the prospect perceives that they need to qualify for your time and offer.

## Key Frameworks

### Frame Control – Types of Frames

Frame Control is the foundation of Klaff's method. It involves establishing and maintaining the dominant framework during the interaction, so the other adapts to your context.

Types of frames:

- **Power frame**
  The "alpha" frame with big ego that tries to control the meeting (executive showing disinterest, imposing rules, looking at phone). To counter it you need to quickly demonstrate you're not intimidated: a subtle challenge with humor is usually the key.

  *SaaS pitch example:*
  Prospect looks at their watch and says: "You have 5 minutes."
  You: "Perfect, I'm also short on time, let's see in those 5 minutes if there's mutual value. If not, we leave it here."
  Signal: your time is as valuable as theirs.

  *Negotiation example:*
  They make you wait 20 minutes and come in dry: "Impress me."
  You: "Sure. Before getting into details, I want to make sure it makes sense for both; if not, we leave it here and that's it."
  Without shouting, you've marked that you're not in submission mode.

- **Time frame**
  Happens when someone uses time as a weapon: "I only have 10 minutes". If you accept servilely, you place yourself below. Klaff's response is reframing: you also have time limitations and can introduce real scarcity (deadlines, spots).

  *SaaS pitch example:*
  "I have another call in 45 minutes, so focus: I'll show you how we solve X and we see if it makes sense to continue. If not, I won't waste more of your time."

  *Negotiation example:*
  "This discount is available until end of quarter. After that we review conditions with the new budget."
  It's clear, not hysterical ultimatum, but marks real window.

- **Analyst frame**
  The interlocutor becomes hyper-logical, cold, obsessed with data. It can kill the emotion of your pitch. Klaff recommends breaking this frame with the intrigue frame: using stories or narrative examples that take them out of Excel mode.

  *SaaS example:*
  Client bombards you with metric questions at minute 3.
  You: "We'll get to the numbers, but first let me tell you what happened in a company like yours when they ignored this problem. That's where the data makes sense."

  *Negotiation example:*
  "Before going to line 32 of the spreadsheet, let me show you the big picture of what the project looks like in your operation. If that map doesn't convince you, neither will the numbers."

- **Prize frame**
  Your base posture: you and your offer are the prize. You don't beg; you evaluate fit.

  *SaaS example:*
  "We work with a limited number of clients per quarter to ensure results. Tell me what makes your company a good candidate for this type of implementation."

  *Negotiation example:*
  Client asks for brutal discount: "I have three cheaper quotes."
  You: "It's totally valid to compare. Our policy isn't to be the cheapest, but the ones that generate the most return. Companies that prioritize results over cost usually choose us. If that's not the priority now, no problem, maybe we'll fit better later."

- **Intrigue frame**
  Uses suspense and curiosity to control attention. You don't reveal everything at once; you leave open questions only you can close later.

  *SaaS example:*
  "We discovered an unexpected way to double conversions in this type of funnels... in a minute I'll show you what we did."

  *Negotiation example:*
  "There was a moment when the project almost failed, and that's when we found something that changed the result. Before telling you what it was, let me show you how it looked like your current situation..."

### The STRONG Method

Pitch structuring method from *Pitch Anything*:

1. **Setting the Frame**
   You set agenda, timing, and approach from the start.

   *SaaS example:*
   "In the next 20 minutes I'll show you how we solve X, and at the end we decide together if a pilot makes sense."

   *Negotiation example:*
   "First let's validate if what we do solves your problem. If not, we close here. If yes, then it makes sense to talk terms."

2. **Telling the Story**
   Instead of opening with data, you open with narrative: problem origin, context, characters.

   *SaaS example:*
   "Two years ago I was head of sales in a company that was losing dozens of hot leads a month without knowing why..."

   *Negotiation example:*
   "Last year a client called us in crisis: they had invested thousands in ads and the checkout still wasn't converting. What we found was..."

3. **Revealing the Intrigue**
   You leave an unresolved element to hook.

   *SaaS example:*
   "We tried something that seemed crazy and in 90 days doubled sales. I'll tell you what it was right away, but first let's see the problem context."

   *Negotiation example:*
   "The funny thing is the breaking point wasn't the price or the product... it was something else. We'll see it in a second."

4. **Offering the Prize**
   You show your offer as the valuable, scarce reward.

   *SaaS example:*
   "We developed a platform that does that automatically. Today we only work with 5 companies of your category, because we prefer quality over quantity."

   *Negotiation example:*
   "We could take this project, but for us it's key to work with committed teams. When that happens, the success cases are big."

5. **Nailing the Hookpoint**
   You show the hard proof that ties it all together (demo, graph, compelling case).

   *SaaS example:*
   "This graph shows what happened with 3 clients: from 3% to 9% conversion in 60 days."

   *Negotiation example:*
   "Here is the before and after in customer service costs: this curve is what we're proposing you experience."

6. **Getting the Decision**
   You don't end with "think about it and let's see"; you seek a concrete next step.

   *SaaS example:*
   "With what we saw, does it make sense to move to a pilot this month or do we leave it here as learning?"

   *Negotiation example:*
   "If you think this solves what you were looking for, I propose closing a framework agreement this quarter. If you don't see it clearly, tell me and we end as friends."

### Croc Brain vs Neocortex

- The **croc brain** filters everything: decides if something is irrelevant, threat, or interesting.
- If it perceives boredom or excessive complexity, it discards the message before reaching the neocortex.
- The pitch must:
  - Be simple at the start.
  - Bring novelty and emotion (risk, opportunity, surprise).
  - Lean on mental images and metaphors.

*SaaS example:*
Instead of: "We're an integrated omnichannel optimization platform..."
You say: "This year companies like yours will lose an average of 5M dollars from invisible leaks in their digital funnels. We found a simple way to plug that leak."

*Negotiation example:*
Instead of going straight to price table:
"Before talking numbers, I want to share something: last week a client similar to yours had a 48-hour e-commerce drop from a detail we could have caught in time. That's exactly what we want to prevent here."

---

### Status Alignment

Objective: place yourself at the same status level as your interlocutor.

Keys:

- Parity signals:
  - Speak their jargon.
  - Reference clients/experiences at their level.
  - Show you know their context.

*SaaS pitch example:*
"I saw in your annual report that you increased investment in retail media. Our best customers are exactly in that transition: lots of budget in retail media, but little control at final conversion level."

*Negotiation example:*
"I've worked with CFOs of companies similar in size to yours; all share three pains: cash visibility, forecasting accuracy, and board pressure. What we're proposing hits precisely those three points."

You avoid beta phrases like:

- "Thanks for your time, I know it's very important, I'll do what you say."
- "Sorry to bother you with this."

And replace with:

- "Thanks for the space, my schedule is also full today, so I'll get to the point."
- "I want to understand if it makes sense for both; if not, we close here and that's it."

---

### Inception (Flip the Script)

Inception = make the idea seem like theirs.

Components:

1. **Status alignment**: if they see you as too low, they won't listen.
2. **Install certainty**: demonstrate expertise (Flash Roll).
3. **Pre-wired ideas**: fit your idea into concepts they already believe.
4. **Changing context**: show why the status quo is dangerous.
5. **Return autonomy**: "you decide, I'm just giving my best recommendation".

*SaaS example (email/message):*
Subject: `A hypothesis on why your traffic isn't converting 💡`
Body, simplified:
"Antonio, I see you're investing heavily in acquisition (you say it in your X campaigns), but there's a pattern I've seen in 50+ ecommerces of your size: 3-5% leaks in checkout from 'invisible' friction.
If I were in your position, I'd look for a solution that already comes with best practices for retail funnels, not something generic.
We built exactly that, but beyond talking about our product, I can teach you the 3 most common mistakes I see and how to avoid them. You decide if it makes sense to look at the tool after."

The subtext is: the idea of "I need something specific for my retail funnel" lights up in their head. You introduce the tool almost as a natural consequence of that idea.

*Negotiation example:*
"If I were in your position, I'd ask myself three questions before signing something like this:
1) Does this really solve the root problem?
2) Can I trust the provider to sustain this 3-5 years?
3) Even with a conservative scenario, is the return reasonable?
If you honestly feel the answer is yes to all three, then it's a good deal. And if not, better not do it, even if it costs me this deal. I can only show you evidence of these three things; the decision is yours."

You guide them to the conclusion, but they feel they decide with their own criteria.

## Signature Tactics

### 1. Defusing the Power Frame

- **What it is:** prick the other's ego without direct confrontation; show you're not below.
- **Example script:**
  "I understand, I also have another meeting after, so we'll get to the point."
  "I see you have a thousand things at once, tell me if at any point you feel this isn't adding value and we'll cut it off without problem."

- **When to use:**
  - When they deliberately make you wait.
  - When they minimize your time ("I have 5 minutes").
  - When you notice an "I'm king here" attitude.

- **When not to use:**
  - When the relationship is already respectful and balanced.
  - When the other comes humble and open: there's nothing to "defuse".

- **How not to seem arrogant:**
  - Use soft humor and calm tone.
  - Talk about your time as valuable, not theirs as less valuable.
  - Don't raise your voice, don't respond with aggressive sarcasm.

---

### 2. Time Constraint

- **What it is:** use real time limits or offer limits to focus and generate healthy urgency.

- **Script example (meeting):**
  "I'll do this in 30 minutes and we'll see if it makes sense to continue. That way we respect everyone's time."

- **Script example (offer):**
  "This proposal with these conditions is designed to close this month; after that we move to next quarter and review budget and prices."

- **When to use:**
  - Eternally indecisive prospects.
  - Processes that stretch unnecessarily.
  - When you really have implementation windows or limited spots.

- **When not to use:**
  - If it's clearly fake (it shows).
  - In very early exploratory stages.
  - In cultures/processes where speed is perceived as lack of seriousness.

- **How not to seem arrogant:**
  - Frame the restriction as logistics: "to reserve the team", "quarter-end".
  - Don't say "if you don't sign today, forget it", but "we'll review new conditions later".
  - Offer alternatives ("if you don't make this deadline, we can think of another modality").

---

### 3. Push-Pull

- **What it is:** alternate interest with a slight retreat to create attraction and avoid seeming needy.

- **Script example:**
  - Push: "I love the project you have in hand, honestly you'd be an ideal client for us..."
  - Pull: "...although, being transparent, we only take projects where we see total commitment. If we don't feel it, we'd rather not move forward."

- **When to use:**
  - When you feel you're chasing more than the client.
  - When the client takes you for granted.
  - To test if there's real interest.

- **When not to use:**
  - With very shy or insecure clients.
  - When you haven't built trust yet.
  - If there's been too much "pull" and they're almost leaving.

- **How not to seem arrogant:**
  - Attribute doubt to your limits ("I don't know if we can..."), not to their inferiority.
  - Keep respectful tone: "I want to be honest with you", not "you're not enough for me".
  - Make sure the push (praise) is genuine.

---

### 4. Prizing

- **What it is:** behave as the authentic prize: you choose clients, not the other way around.

- **Script example:**
  "We choose who we work with because we know without commitment from both sides there's no success case. I'm interested in understanding if this is a real priority for you."

- **When to use:**
  - When the client behaves with arrogance.
  - When you have enough demand or a very differential product.
  - At the end of a process to mark that you're not begging.

- **When not to use:**
  - In long-term relationships where trust is already established.
  - If your offer isn't really special (or the market is saturated with equals).
  - In contexts of very high sensitivity/power of the other (e.g., highly regulated public tenders).

- **How not to seem arrogant:**
  - Use facts ("we have a 2-month waitlist"), not adjectives ("we're the best").
  - Focus on mutual "fit", not on "I'm superior".
  - Keep collaboration language: "partnering", "working together", not "accepting or rejecting you".

---

### 5. Intrigue Ping

- **What it is:** micro-curiosity shots that open loops in the other's mind.

- **Script example (SaaS demo):**
  "There's a piece of data about your customer behavior that usually leaves marketing directors frozen... in a second I'll show you."

- **Script example (email):**
  Subject: `An anomaly I saw in your sales funnel`
  Body: "I saw something odd in your campaigns that I usually anticipate before a sales slump. If you want, I'll explain it in 5 minutes."

- **When to use:**
  - At the start to hook.
  - In the middle of a meeting when attention drops.
  - In cold outreach to provoke opening.

- **When not to use:**
  - If you never plan to close the loop (it will come across as cheap trick).
  - If what you're about to reveal isn't really interesting.
  - In ultra-formal contexts where going straight to facts is wanted.

- **How not to seem arrogant:**
  - Promise value, not mystery for mystery's sake.
  - Deliver the promised content with clarity and generosity.
  - Use a complicity tone, not "I know something you don't".

---

### 6. Hot Cognition Triggers

- **What it is:** insert emotional elements that push to decide (desire, fear, status, scarcity).

- **Script example (vision):**
  "Imagine in six months looking at this dashboard and seeing double the revenue with the same team. That's the kind of scenario we're looking for here."

- **Script example (scarcity):**
  "We have real capacity to implement two projects of this type this quarter. If we leave it for later, it'll be in the next cycle."

- **When to use:**
  - As closing approaches.
  - When you notice the prospect is excessively cold.
  - In presentations where you need them to remember your message.

- **When not to use:**
  - If they're already very excited/anxious; you could saturate.
  - If you can't back the promise with facts.
  - With ultra-analytical profiles without dressing it in data.

- **How not to seem manipulative:**
  - Back emotion with proof (cases, metrics, demos).
  - Don't exaggerate benefits ridiculously.
  - Ask the prospect how they'd feel / what it would mean to them (let the emotion come from their own imagination).

---

### 7. The Flip

- **What it is:** get the client to be the one who proposes moving forward.

- **Script example:**
  "I showed you everything we do. If you wanted to implement this, what would be the logical next step from your side?"

  or

  "What would you need to see or have from our side to say yes with peace of mind?"

- **When to use:**
  - When you see real interest but lack final "push".
  - To test commitment before investing more energy.
  - In stages where you've already shared enough value.

- **When not to use:**
  - When they're still cold or confused.
  - When the process has mandatory steps you haven't fulfilled yet.
  - With clients who expect strong guidance (they might feel abandoned).

- **How not to seem indifferent:**
  - Frame the flip as respect for their process: "I don't want to pressure you".
  - After their response, show immediate action: "Perfect, if that's the step, I'll do A and B to facilitate it."
  - Keep collaboration tone, not "I don't care what you do".

---

### 8. Local Star Power

- **What it is:** establish yourself quickly as a recognized authority in that specific context.

- **Script example (personal introduction):**
  "Before getting into the solution, I'll tell you that last year we led a project with [known brand] that reduced their delivery times by 30%. That's the learning I bring today."

- **Script example (opening slide):**
  A slide with relevant client logos, awards, or key event participations, while you say: "These are some of the companies and events where we've applied this approach."

- **When to use:**
  - In the first minutes of a new meeting.
  - When there are people in the room who don't know you.
  - When you sense initial skepticism.

- **When not to use:**
  - When your reputation is already fully installed with that audience.
  - When the cultural context penalizes direct self-promotion.

- **How not to seem arrogant:**
  - Tell achievements as stories or facts, not as self-praise.
  - Attribute part of the merit to the team or clients.
  - Be brief: 20-40 seconds of "star power" is enough.

---

## Quotable Lines

- "When you react to the other person, they own the frame. When the other person reacts to what you do and say, you own the frame."
- "Money isn't a prize. It's just a means to transfer value. The real prize is you and what you know."
- "If you don't control the frame, you're playing within someone else's frame. And in that game, you almost always lose."
- "Frames influence judgment. They change the meaning of human behavior."
- "No message will reach the logical center of the other person's brain without first passing through the survival filters of the reptilian brain."
- "Make the idea seem like it comes from them, and they'll defend it more than you could defend it."
- "Influence is stronger when the other person feels you're at the same status level as them, not above or below."
- "Rebellion with humor is one of the cleanest ways to take power in a meeting."
- "Remember: you are the prize, not the buyer. If you don't put yourself in that place, no one else will do it for you."

---

## Best For (When to activate this advisor)

- Pitch decks and presentations where you need to stand out among many.
- Meetings where you enter with less status (young founder vs senior director, small agency vs big corporate).
- Situations where the prospect acts like they're doing you a favor by listening.
- SaaS/service demos where you need to control pace and agenda.
- Scenarios where you feel you're chasing the client and losing power.
- Cold emails and outreach messages that need to break initial indifference.
- Technical founders or very analytical profiles who tend to hide in data and yield ground in the commercial dynamic.

---

## Red Flags (When NOT to use)

- Trust relationships already established, where power play can damage a healthy relationship.
- Situations where you objectively have very little leverage and the other party knows it (trying to play the prize can sound fake).
- Contexts and cultures where explicit humility is highly valued and strong assertiveness is perceived as bad manners.
- Post-sale, support, and customer success stages where the focus should be service, not frame control.

---

## Synergies (Combines well with)

- **Hormozi:**
  - Hormozi gives you the structure of the irresistible offer (disproportionate value).
  - Klaff gives you the frame to present that offer as scarce prize.
  - Combination: "stupidly good" offer + prizing and urgency = hard to reject.

- **Voss:**
  - Voss adds tactical empathy, listening, and fine negotiation language.
  - Klaff brings frame control and status.
  - Combination: you can set boundaries, challenge, and control the meeting without losing emotional connection or seeming aggressive.

- **Cialdini:**
  - Cialdini's authority and scarcity integrate perfectly with Klaff's star power, time frame, and prizing.
  - Social proof reinforces your stories and intrigue pings ("other companies like yours are already doing it").
  - Combination: client's mental structure predisposed (Cialdini) + scene dominance (Klaff).

---

## Anti-patterns (Conflicts with)

- Pure "SPIN" consultative selling models:
  - SPIN prioritizes asking a lot, listening, and leaving the client totally in charge of pace.
  - Klaff proposes directing more strongly, telling stories, and challenging.
  - Mixing them without intention produces contradictory signals: you go from submissive to dominant.

- Extreme "servant selling" approaches:
  - If the organization culture is "whatever the client wants, whenever they want it", hard frame control will clash.
  - Trying prizing in that context can sound dissonant with internal values.

- Ultra-soft selling based only on empathy:
  - If you always validate everything the client says, never set boundaries, and suddenly introduce power frames, it's perceived as weird.
  - With these styles, if you want to use Klaff, it's usually better to design a specific process where frame control is applied from minute 1, rather than trying to graft it in the middle of a relationship where you were always "soft".
